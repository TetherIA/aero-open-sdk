## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

The SDK is currently tested for Python 3.10 and above.

### üì¶ Install via pip

```bash
pip install aero-hand-sdk
```

### üß© Install from source (editable mode)

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TetherIA/aero-open-sdk.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:
   ```bash
   cd aero-open-sdk
   ```

3. Install the package in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è One-Time Setup

When setting up your hand for the first time, our setup GUI helps you configure motor IDs and test motor connections.

After installation, launch the Setup GUI with:

```bash
aero-hand-gui
```

This provides an interactive interface to configure your hand.

---

## üîå Serial Port Setup

Aero Hand connects to the host PC via a serial (USB) interface.
To operate the SDK, you must specify the correct serial port for your device.

### üêß Linux

Most Linux systems assign the device path as `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`. You can list connected serial devices with:

```bash
ls /dev/ttyACM* /dev/ttyUSB*
```

**üí° Persistent Device Path (Recommended)**

Device names like `/dev/ttyUSB0` can change each time you reconnect.

To get a persistent name, use the by-id symlink instead:

```bash
ls -l /dev/serial/by-id/
```

This will show you a list of connected serial devices with more descriptive names. Look for the one that corresponds to your Aero Hand. Which will look something like:
```bash
usb-Espressif_USB_JTAG_serial_debug_unit_D8:3B:DA:45:C8:1C-if00
```
Then initialize your hand using that path:
```python
from aero_open_sdk.aero_hand import AeroHand

aero_hand = AeroHand(
  port="/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Espressif_USB_JTAG_serial_debug_unit_D8:3B:DA:45:C8:1C-if00"
)
```
‚úÖ This ensures your connection always points to the correct device, even if you unplug and replug the hand or change the USB port.

### ü™ü Windows
On Windows, the device will appear as a COM port like `COM3` or `COM4`. You can find the correct COM port by checking the Device Manager under "Ports (COM & LPT)".

You can then Initialize your hand with the detected COM port:
```python
from aero_open_sdk.aero_hand import AeroHand
aero_hand = AeroHand(port="COM3")
```
**üí° Making the COM Port Persistent**

Windows does not have a /by-id/ system like Linux, so the COM number can change if you plug the device into a different USB port.

To make it permanent, you can assign a fixed COM number:
1. Plug in the Aero Hand and open Device Manager.
2. Find it under Ports (COM & LPT).
3. Right-click ‚Üí Properties ‚Üí Port Settings ‚Üí Advanced.
4. In COM Port Number, select an unused port (e.g., COM5).
5. Click OK to save.

You can now always use this COM port when initializing the SDK.

## üß∞ Troubleshooting

### 1. Installation Fails (`pip install` error)

If installation fails, try the following steps:

- Check your Python version:

    Make sure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.

- üîß Upgrade pip to the latest version:

    Our package requires an up-to-date version of pip.

    You can upgrade pip with:
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

On Windows, if you see error like "pip is not recognized", use the `py` launcher command instead:

    ```bash
    py -m pip install --upgrade pip
    ```

### 2. Path Mismatch on Windows

- You may not have the Python Scripts path added to your system PATH environment variable.

- To fix this, you can either:

  1. Add the Python Scripts directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python310\Scripts`) to your system PATH.
  2. Or use the `py` launcher command to launch the GUI directly:
      ```bash
      py -m aero_open_sdk
      ```
